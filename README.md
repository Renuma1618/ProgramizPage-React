# Web Application- Programiz Page 

Created a React project folder structure.

Built components for navigating to individual pages for each programming language.

Implemented routing using react-router-dom for clean and dynamic URLs.

Used the useNavigate hook and onClick events to enable interactive and clickable navigation between pages.
